This is my first attempt at recreating a web page given a beginner's understanding of HTML and CSS.
In doing so I gained familiarity with semantic HTML (particularly header and footer elements), how to create nav-bars, the tricky nature of vertical centering elements, block and inline-bblock values for the property display, and text-decoration for hyperlinks.
